                    Thomas Edison
                </h2>
                <p>Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor <br>and businessman. He developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation, mass <br>communication, sound recording, and motion pictures. These inventions, which include the phonograph, <br>the motion picture camera, and early versions of the electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world. <br> He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science<br>and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees. He established<br>the first industrial research laboratory.<br>
                    Edison was raised in the American Midwest. Early in his career he worked as a telegraph operator, which <br> inspired some of his earliest inventions. In 1876, <br> he established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park,<br>New Jersey, where many of his early inventions were developed. <br> He later established a botanical laboratory <br> in Fort Myers, Florida, in collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and Harvey S. Firestone, and a <br> laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, that featured the world's first film studio, the Black Maria. With 1,093 <br> US patents in his name, as well as patents in other countries, Edison is regarded as the most prolific inventor <br> in American history. Edison married twice and fathered six children. He died in 1931 due to complications from diabetes.</p>

                <p>
                    An incandescent light bulb, incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe is an electric light with a wire filament <br> that is heated until it glows. The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb that is filled with vacuum or inert gas to protect the filament <br> from oxidation. Current is supplied to the filament by terminals or wires embedded in the glass. A bulb socket <br> provides mechanical support and electrical connections.<br>

                    Incandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes, light output, and voltage ratings, from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts. <br> They require no external regulating equipment, have low manufacturing costs, and work equally well on either <br> alternating current or direct current. As a result, the incandescent bulb became widely used in household and commercial <br> lighting, for portable lighting such as table lamps, car headlamps, and flashlights, and for decorative and advertising lighting.
                    Incandescent bulbs are much less efficient than other types of electric lighting. Less than 5% of the energy they consume <br> is converted into visible light; the rest is lost as heat.The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb for 120 V <br> operation is 16 lumens per watt (lm/W), compared with 60 lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 100 lm/W for typical <br> white LED lamps.

                    The heat produced by filaments is used in some applications, such as heat lamps in incubators, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy. <br> Quartz envelope halogen infrared heaters are used for industrial processes such as paint curing and space heating.

                    Incandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared with other types of lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light <br> bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 20,000–30,000 hours for lighting LEDs. Most <br> incandescent bulbs can be replaced by fluorescent lamps, high-intensity discharge lamps, and light-emitting diode <br> lamps (LED). Some governments have begun a phase-out of incandescent light bulbs to reduce energy consumption.
